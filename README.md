# ðŸ§± Tetris in x86 Assembly

**Tetris** is a complete Tetris clone developed in **x86 Assembly language (8088)** using low-level hardware control, designed to run in a DOS environment. It features custom video rendering, score tracking, real-time timer, and shape rotationsâ€”all from scratch.

>  This project was developed as part of a university coursework project on low-level programming and systems architecture.

- Time tracking via BIOS timer interrupt (`int 08h`)
- Real-time key detection for movement (A, D), rotation (W/S)
- Manual memory boundary checks
- Row-clearing logic with base memory update
- Custom animated splash and end screens using pixel graphics
- Runs in real mode using BIOS & DOS interrupts
